### Turn Your Leftovers into Culinary Masterpieces with AI-Powered Chefs

 


## üöÄ The Problem

How often do you stare into your fridge, see a random assortment of ingredients, and have no idea what to cook? Meal Architect solves this by transforming your available ingredients into unique, delicious recipes, all guided by the distinct personalities of world-class AI chefs.

## ‚ú® The Solution

Meal Architect is a full-stack web application that allows users to:
1.  **Enter** the ingredients they have on hand.
2.  **Choose** a culinary style from one of three AI-powered chefs.
3.  **Receive** a unique, step-by-step recipe complete with a title, cooking time, and personalized chef's notes.

The magic is in the personalities. The same ingredients will produce wildly different dishes depending on which chef you choose!
